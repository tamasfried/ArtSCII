# ArtSCII üé®‚û°Ô∏èüî°

**ArtSCII** is a Python project that converts images into ASCII art.  
The goal is to build both a **command-line tool** and a simple **web app** where users can upload an image and see it transformed into ASCII characters.

---

## Project Goals
- Convert images to ASCII using a small set of characters.
- Preserve the aspect ratio so the ASCII "image" looks correct.
- Provide options like:
  - Width of the output
  - Dense or simple character sets
  - Inverted brightness mapping
  - Color output (using ANSI codes in the terminal)
- Make a web interface (using Streamlit) so it can be used easily without the terminal.

## Current Status
This is a work in progress.  
- [x] Set up project structure and environment  
- [ ] Core conversion logic  
- [ ] Command-line interface  
- [ ] Web app
